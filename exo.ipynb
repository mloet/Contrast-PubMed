It is well known that platelets play important roles not only in hemostasis, but also in thrombosis and inflammation. Objective To evaluate whether platelet-FVIII expression might increase thrombotic risk and thereby compromise the safety of this approach. Methods In this study, platelet-FVIII-expressing transgenic mice were examined either in steady-state conditions or under prothrombotic conditions induced by inflammation or the FV Leiden mutation. Native whole blood thrombin generation assay, rotational thromboelastometry analysis and ferric chloride-induced vessel injury were used to evaluate the hemostatic properties. Various parameters associated with thrombosis risk, including D-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin complexes, fibrinogen, tissue fibrin deposition, platelet activation status and activatability, and platelet-leukocyte aggregates, were assessed. Results We generated a new line of transgenic mice that expressed 30-fold higher levels of platelet-expressed FVIII than are therapeutically required to restore hemostasis in hemophilic mice. Under both steady-state conditions and prothrombotic conditions induced by lipopolysaccharide-mediated inflammation or the FV Leiden mutation, supratherapeutic levels of platelet-expressed FVIII did not appear to be thrombogenic. Furthermore, FVIII-expressing platelets were neither hyperactivated nor hyperactivatable upon agonist activation. Conclusion We conclude that, in mice, more than 30-fold higher levels of platelet-expressed FVIII than are required for therapeutic efficacy in hemophilia A are not associated with a thrombotic predilection.',\n",

We tested the hypothesis that if adjusted for clearance rate, the SF concentration of cartilage proteoglycans (PG) estimates severity of chondropathy and predicts progression of cartilage damage more accurately than if clearance is not taken into account.',\n",
       "    'Clearance of radioiodinated serum albumin (RISA), a surrogate for the clearance of PG, was measured in 19 adult dogs at baseline and again 16 weeks and 32 weeks after anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT). Severity of chondropathy was determined arthroscopically after 16 weeks of instability and at postmortem 32 weeks after ACLT.',\n",
       "    'Adjustment for the RISA clearance rate showed that the SF PG concentration markedly underestimated the quantity of PG released from the OA cartilage. Regardless of whether the concentration was adjusted for clearance, no correlation existed between the SF PG level and the severity of chondropathy. Further, the SF concentration of PG 16 weeks after ACLT failed to predict severity of cartilage damage at postmortem.'],\n",

Older caregivers of spouses with dementia show a poorer immune response against latent viruses when compared to age- and sex-matched controls. Younger parental caregivers of children with developmental disabilities show a poorer antibody response to vaccination. What does this study add? The study showed no association between caregiving stress and CMV antibody titre in young caregivers. There were higher CMV antibody titres in the caregivers who engage in unhealthy behaviours.',\n",

We tested whether the capacity of the inhaled anesthetic isoflurane to produce immobility in the face of noxious stimulation resulted from agonism of alpha-adrenoreceptors. MAC (the concentration required to eliminate movement in response to a noxious stimulus in 50% of subjects) of isoflurane was determined before and after intraperitoneal administration of the alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonists yohimbine and atipamezole. The doses of yohimbine and atipamezole equaled or exceeded those that reverse the ability of agonism of alpha-adrenoreceptors to decrease MAC. Smaller doses of yohimbine or atipamezole slightly increased (by 10%) the MAC of isoflurane, an increase we interpret as the result of blockade of a small amount of tonically active alpha-adrenoreceptor activity.

Parkin is thought to be critical for protecting dopaminergic neurons from toxic insults by targeting misfolded or oxidatively damaged proteins for proteasomal degradation. Surprisingly, mice with targeted deletions of parkin do not recapitulate robust behavioral or pathological signs of parkinsonism. Since Parkin is thought to protect against neurotoxic insults, we hypothesized that the reason Parkin-deficient mice do not develop parkinsonism is because they are not exposed to appropriate environmental triggers. To test this possibility, we challenged Parkin-deficient mice with neurotoxic regimens of either methamphetamine (METH) or 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Because Parkin function has been linked to many of the pathways involved in METH and 6-OHDA toxicity, we predicted that Parkin-deficient mice would be more sensitive to the neurotoxic effects of these agents.',\n",

Alternatively, it remains possible that the absence of parkinsonism in Parkin-deficient mice could reflect fundamental differences between the function of human and mouse Parkin, or the existence of a redundant E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase in mouse that is not found in humans.

Previous studies showed that familial nonsyndromic PFE is caused by heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the G protein-coupled receptor (PTH1R) for PTH and PTHrP. Thus, we hypothesized that PTHrP resistance could result in failure of tooth eruption (FTE) and/or brachydactyly in PHP.',\n",

Although private-for-profit facilities were engaged in immunisation service provision their participation was low as only 30% (95% CI 27-34) of the survey respondents utilised these facilities. The low participation could be due to lack of financial support for immunisation activities at these facilities. This in turn could explain the rampant informal charges for services in this setting.

To evaluate GAB2-APOE genegene interactions, we stratified our series according to APOE genotype and case-control status, in accordance with the original studies.

Compared with 16 untreated animals, beta-adrenoceptor antagonism was documented in the treated group by 1) pharmacological stimulation with isoproterenol, 2) physiological stimulation during graded treadmill exercise, and 3) repeated long-term biotelemetry recordings of oxygen demand (heart rate and blood pressure) and regional myocardial function. In addition to pharmacological and physiological verification of beta-blockade, biotelemetry showed that, compared with the untreated animals, propranolol significantly reduced the daily number, individual duration, and severity of events representing myocardial dysfunction. This suggests that in the beta-blocked group, little if any ischemia was present throughout the first 5 weeks when collateral growth occurs. Transmural myocardial blood flow (expressed as a ratio of flow in the LCx region to the nonoccluded region of the left ventricle) and systolic wall thickening in the LCx region were determined at rest and during treadmill exercise (240 beats per minute) 31-38 days (5 weeks) and 60-67 days (8 weeks) after surgery.

C-ANF (des-[Gln18,Ser19,Gly20,Leu21,Gly22]ANP(4- 23)) a specific ligand for ANP-C receptors, displaced 30% of total binding with a lower affinity than ANF. C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) displaced [125I]-ANF binding in a biphasic manner, indicating that it binds to two sites with affinities three orders of magnitude apart. When CNP was incubated in the presence of 0.1 mumol/l C-ANF to saturate ANP-C receptors, the high-affinity binding site vanished and maximum binding decreased to 70%, suggesting that CNP binds with high affinity to ANP-C receptors. Since the ANP-A receptor has little or no avidity for CNP, it is probably the low-affinity binding site. CNP and C-ANF displaced most [125I]-[Tyr]CNP(1-22) binding with very close affinities, indicating that CNP binds primarily preglomerular vascular ANP-C receptors. In glomeruli CNP behaved similarly to C-ANF in its ability to displace approximately 85% of [125I]-ANF binding; the remaining 15% was completely displaced by ANF. C-ANF and CNP inhibited 100% of [125I]-[Tyr]CNP(1-22) binding. Both findings suggest that [125I]-[Tyr]CNP(1-22) binds ANP-C receptors exclusively. In renal papillae no displacement of [125I]-ANF by C-ANF was observed, and CNP was bound to ANP-A receptors with the same very low affinity as in preglomerular vessels. The absence of [125I]-[Tyr]CNP(1-22) binding to papillary membranes indicates that ANP-B receptors are not expressed in that tissue.

Importantly, posterior distributions of expression are obtained regardless of the number of replicates available. We exploit these posterior distributions to create ranked gene lists that take into account the estimated expression difference as well as its associated uncertainty. We estimate the proportion of non-differentially expressed genes empirically, allowing an informed choice of cut-off for the ranked gene list, adapting an approach proposed by Efron.

Therefore, we investigated the effect of adenovirus infection on insulin unresponsiveness by means of Akt activation in cultured cells. Moreover, we investigated the use of baculovirus as a heterologous viral gene delivery vehicle to circumvent these phenomena.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the modifications occurring at the proteomic level following an allopolyploidization event and to determine whether these changes are related to functional properties of the proteins. In a previous report, we applied comparative proteomics to synthetic amphiploids of Brassica napus and to its diploid progenitors B. rapa and B. oleracea. Although several hundred polypeptides displayed additivity (i.e. mid-parent values) in the amphiploids, many of them showed non-additivity.

Components of protein complexes were identified of which approximately 50% also displayed \"different\" or \"opposite\" patterns of regulation in the allotetraploids. In silico functional categorization of the identified proteins was carried out, and showed that neither functional category nor metabolic pathway were systematically affected by non-additivity in the synthetic amphiploids.

Its major side effect is hypertension, which occurs in 8-30% of uremic patients. The exact mechanism of rHuEpo-induced hypertension has not been fully elucidated, and several possibilities have been proposed, such as a direct vascular effect of the drug with a shift in the balance of constrictor and relaxing endothelial factors (endothelins and nitric oxide (NO)). Recent papers suggested an enhanced rather than reduced activity of endogenous NO system in rats with normal renal function and rHuEpo-induced hypertension. Our study was designed to verify whether, in spite of enhanced activity of the renal NO system, rHuEpo may affect endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine-induced) and/or endothelium-independent (sodium nitroprusside-induced) vasorelaxation and to evaluate basal NO release by the infusion of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) in an isolated and perfused rat kidney model.',\n",

There were no significant differences in the dose-response curves to Ach and SNP between the two groups. The renal vasoconstriction following the infusion of L-NAME was also similar in the two groups.'],\n",

The presence of inflamed cardiac mucosa at the GEJ or carditis was inversely related to H. pylori infection and strongly associated with increased esophageal acid exposure. There was no association between the presence of intestinal metaplasia and H. pylori infection. Helicobacter pylori was found in 22 (19.3%) of the 114 patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma, which was not different from the prevalence of H. pylori in patients with benign disease.'],\n",

The United States, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and the People\\'s Republic of China supported the Islamist Afghan mujahadeen guerillas against the military forces of the Soviet Union and the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. A small number of \"Afghan Arab\" volunteers joined the fight against the Soviets, including Osama bin Laden, but there is no evidence they received any external assistance. In May 1996 the group World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders , sponsored by bin Laden , started forming a large base of operations in Afghanistan, where the Islamist extremist regime of the Taliban had seized power earlier in the year. In February 1998, Osama bin Laden signed a fatwā, as head of al-Qaeda, declaring war on the West and Israel. Earlier in August 1996, Bin Laden declared jihad against the United States. Later in May 1998 al-Qaeda released a video declaring war on the U.S. and the West. On 7 August 1998, al-Qaeda struck the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing 224 people, including 12 Americans. In retaliation, U.S. President Bill Clinton launched Operation Infinite Reach, a bombing campaign in Sudan and Afghanistan against targets the U.S. asserted were associated with WIFJAJC, although others have questioned whether a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan was used as a chemical warfare facility. The plant produced much of the region\\'s antimalarial drugs and around 50% of Sudan\\'s pharmaceutical needs. The strikes failed to kill any leaders of WIFJAJC or the Taliban. Next came the 2000 millennium attack plots, which included an attempted bombing of Los Angeles International Airport. On 12 October 2000, the USS Cole bombing occurred near the port of Yemen, and 17 U.S. Navy sailors were killed.',\n",

       "  'context': 'The population of the island is believed to have varied from 40,000 to 60,000 in the period ranging from initial settlement until the mid-19th century. During that time, cold winters, ash fall from volcanic eruptions, and bubonic plagues adversely affected the population several times. There were 37 famine years in Iceland between 1500 and 1804. After the destructive volcanic eruptions of the Laki during 1783-1784, the population reached a low of about 40,000. This was after the first census carried out in 1703 and revealed that the population was then 50,358.  Improving living conditions have triggered a rapid increase in population since the mid-19th century; from about 60,000 in 1850 to 320,000 in 2008. Iceland has a relatively young population for a developed country, with one out of five people being 14 years old or younger. With a fertility rate of 2.1, Iceland is one of only a few European countries with a birth rate Replacement fertility rate.',\n",

Throughout the first two invasions, he had steadfastly refused to recall the main Burmese armies, which had been battling in Laos and Siam since January 1766, and laying siege to the Siamese capital of Ayutthaya since January 1765. Throughout 1767, when the Chinese were mobilizing for their most serious invasion yet, the Burmese were still focused on defeating the Siamese. Even after the Siamese capital was finally captured in April 1767, Hsinbyushin kept part of the troops in Siam during the rainy season months in order to mop up the remaining Siamese resistance during the winter months later that year. He actually allowed many Shan and Laotian battalions to demobilize at the start of the rainy season. As a result, when the invasion did come in November 1767, the Burmese defenses had not been upgraded to meet a much larger and a more determined foe. The Burmese command looked much like that of the second invasion. Hsinbyushin again assigned the same commanders of the second invasion to face off the Chinese.

       "  'context': 'The Burmese now faced the largest Chinese army yet mobilized against them. Yet King Hsinbyushin did not seem to realize the gravity of the situation. Throughout the first two invasions, he had steadfastly refused to recall the main Burmese armies, which had been battling in Laos and Siam since January 1765, and laying siege to the Siamese capital of Ayutthaya since January 1766. Throughout 1767, when the Chinese were mobilizing for their most serious invasion yet, the Burmese were still focused on defeating the Siamese. Even after the Siamese capital was finally captured in April 1767, Hsinbyushin kept part of the troops in Siam during the rainy season months in order to mop up the remaining Siamese resistance during the winter months later that year. He actually allowed many Shan and Laotian battalions to demobilize at the start of the rainy season. As a result, when the invasion did come in November 1767, the Burmese defenses had not been upgraded to meet a much larger and a more determined foe. The Burmese command looked much like that of the second invasion. Hsinbyushin again assigned the same commanders of the second invasion to face off the Chinese. Maha Sithu led the main Burmese army, and was the overall commander of the Chinese theater, with Maha Thiha Thura and Ne Myo Sithu commanding two other Burmese armies.

Leopold had also been offended by Richard casting down his standard from the walls of Acre in 1191. He was later transferred to the custody of Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor, and it took a ransom of one hundred and fifty thousand marks to obtain his release. Richard returned to England in 1194 and died of a crossbow bolt wound in 1199 at the age of 41. Henry of Champagne was killed in an accidental fall in 1197. In 1193, Saladin died of yellow fever.

Queen Isabella then married for a fourth time, to Amalric of Lusignan, who had succeeded his brother Guy, positioned as King of Cyprus.

Richard's decision not to attack Jerusalem would lead to the call for a Fourth Crusade six years after the third ended in 1192.

The Cowboys then increased their lead later in the quarter with a 3-yard TD run by running back Marion Barber. In the second quarter, the Saints would score their only points of the half with kicker Garrett Hartley nailing a 34-yard field goal.

Following a Dallas three-and-out, New Orleans made it a one touchdown game when quarterback Drew Brees hit wide receiver Lance Moore for a 7-yard TD pass.

The Cowboys then took a knee to end the game. With the loss, the Saints fell to 13-1, ending their chance at a perfect season.

By the summer of 1601 he had retaken most of the principal castles in Munster and scattered the Irish forces. He did this by negotiating a pact with Florence MacCarthy, the principal Gaelic Irish leader in the province, which allowed MacCarthy to be neutral, while Carew concentrated on attacking the force of James Fitzthomas Fitzgerald, who commanded the main rebel force. As a result, while MacCarthy resisted English raiding parties into his territory, he did not come to Fitzthomas's aid, despite urgings from O'Neill and O'Donnell to do this. In the summer of 1600, Carew launched an offensive against Fitzthomas's forces. The English routed Fitzthomas' forces at Aherlow and in November, Carew reported to London that he had, over the summer, killed 1,200 'rebels' and taken the surrenders of over 10,000. Carew also weakened Florence MacCarthy's position by recruiting a rival MacCarthy chieftain, Donal, to English service. In June 1601, James Fitzthomas was captured by the English forces. Shortly afterwards, Carew had Florence MacCarthy arrested after summoning him for negotiations. Both Fitzthomas and MacCarthy were held captive in the Tower of London, where both eventually died.

       "  'context': \"George Carew, the English Lord President of Munster, managed more or less to quash the rebellion in Munster by mid-1601, using a mixture of conciliation and force. By the summer of 1601 he had retaken most of the principal castles in Munster and scattered the Irish forces. He did this by negotiating a pact with Florence MacCarthy, the principal Gaelic Irish leader in the province, which allowed MacCarthy to be neutral, while Carew concentrated on attacking the force of James Fitzthomas Fitzgerald, who commanded the main rebel force. As a result, while MacCarthy resisted English raiding parties into his territory, he did not come to Fitzthomas's aid, despite urgings from O'Neill and O'Donnell to do this. In the summer of 1600, Carew launched an offensive against Fitzthomas's forces. The English routed Fitzthomas' forces at Aherlow and in November, Carew reported to London that he had, over the summer, killed 1,200 'rebels' and taken the surrenders of over 10,000. Carew also weakened Florence MacCarthy's position by recruiting a rival MacCarthy chieftain, Donal, to English service. In June 1601, James Fitzthomas was captured by the English forces. Shortly afterwards, Carew had Florence MacCarthy arrested after summoning him for negotiations. Both Fitzthomas and MacCarthy were held captive in the Tower of London, where both eventually died. Most of the rest of the local lords submitted, once the principal native leaders had been arrested. O'Neill's mercenaries had been expelled from the province.\",\n",

       "  'context': 'The first war began as a result of disputes between a prominent African merchant, John Cabess  who had armed forces loyal to him, in Eguafo and the Dutch West India Company . Cabess was a formal and loyal ally to the British Royal African Company and assisted their operations in the region. The Dutch, in competition with the Royal African Company, had a series of disputes with Cabess including an instance in 1684 with the Dutch panyarring Cabess and taking his goods. The disputes intensified in November 1694 when Cabess invited the British Royal African Company to return to Komenda and then attacked Dutch miners outside of the city. With the British reoccupying the former British fort in Komenda they were fired upon by the Dutch fort. As a result of these hostilities, the British, Dutch, and Eguafo king began contacting possible allies in surrounding African kingdoms to prepare for a war. Cabess Terra and Twifo initially joined the Dutch, but this alliance was stopped when Denkyira threatened to attack Twifo if war should break out. The Adoms took money from Eguafo to remain neutral in any fighting. War broke out in February 1695 when the forces of John Cabess attacked the Dutch fort and prevented reinforcements. On April 28, 1695, the Twifo forces were defeated. The war then largely took the form of panyarring where one force would seize members of other groups regularly. John Cabess and the Dutch began negotiations that year, but on June 26, the Dutch head at the fort, Willem Bosman, drew a pistol and attempted to shoot at Cabess.

       "  'context': 'The first war began as a result of disputes between a prominent African merchant, John Cabess  who had armed forces loyal to him, in Eguafo and the Dutch West India Company . Cabess was a formal and loyal ally to the British Royal African Company and assisted their operations in the region. The Dutch, in competition with the Royal African Company, had a series of disputes with Cabess including an instance in 1684 with the Dutch panyarring Cabess and taking his goods. The disputes intensified in November 1694 when Cabess invited the British Royal African Company to return to Komenda and then attacked Dutch miners outside of the city. With the British reoccupying the former British fort in Komenda they were fired upon by the Dutch fort. As a result of these hostilities, the British, Dutch, and Eguafo king began contacting possible allies in surrounding African kingdoms to prepare for a war. Cabess Terra and Twifo initially joined the Dutch, but this alliance was stopped when Denkyira threatened to attack Twifo if war should break out. The Adoms took money from Eguafo to remain neutral in any fighting. War broke out in February 1695 when the forces of John Cabess attacked the Dutch fort and prevented reinforcements. On April 28, 1695, the Twifo forces were defeated. The war then largely took the form of panyarring where one force would seize members of other groups regularly. A short-lived peace settlement was reached in the end of 1695, a few months after an unfortunate incident when the Dutch head at the fort, Willem Bosman, drew a pistol and attempted to shoot at Cabess.',\n",

Additionally, special forces and Ministry of Internal Affairs troops were deployed. The total number of troops was 16,000 according to the magazine. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, ten light infantry battalions of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th infantry brigades, special forces and an artillery brigade, totalling approximately 12,000 troops, had been concentrated by the start of the conflict. The primary task of capturing Tskhinvali was accomplished by the 4th Brigade with support from the 2nd and 3rd Brigades. According to the EU fact-finding mission, 10,000-11,000 soldiers took part in the war. The 1st Infantry Brigade, the only one trained to NATO standards, was serving in Iraq at the beginning of the war; on 11 August, the United States Air Force airlifted it to Georgia. The elite Georgian troops were overdue from Iraq and could not participate in the fighting. The presence of prime 2,000 Georgian military and the most Georgian high-level government officials abroad before the war meant that Georgia did not intend to attack.:57',\n",

       "  'context': \"In May 1704, a Bourbon army won a series of minor victories along the Spain/Portugal border, offset by the Allied capture of Gibraltar, a vital strategic possession. Attempts to retake it were defeated at the naval Battle of Málaga in August, with a land siege having been abandoned in July. In June 1705, the 'Pact of Genoa' between Catalan representatives and England opened a second front in the north-east; the loss of Barcelona and Valencia meant Toulon was the only major port available to the Bourbons in the Western Mediterranean.

Religious persecution of the local Catholics exacerbated the discontent, which turned into open revolt in 1637. The Tokugawa Shogunate sent a force of over 125,000 troops to suppress the rebels and, after a lengthy siege against the rebels at Hara Castle, defeated them. In the wake of the rebellion, the Catholic rebel leader Amakusa Shirō was beheaded and the prohibition of Christianity was strictly enforced. Japan's national seclusion policy was tightened and official persecution of Christianity continued until the 1850s.

       " 'context': {'contexts': ['Programmed cell death (PCD) is the regulated death of cells within an organism. The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants.',\n",
       "   'The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (ΔΨm). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells.'],\n",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.',\n",
